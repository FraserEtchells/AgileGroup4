Week 2:

Day 1 - 3/2/2020
Members Present: Michael (SM), Fraser, Patryk, Aditya, Tom, Josh
Summary:
- Before the meeting, we looked at feedback from last sprint concerning the client meeting and the work we had done.
- We also looked at the product backlog, and created a new sprint backlog to work on, distributing tasks between members.
- We agreed to move the meetings from 2pm to 11am, as the later time seemed to make the group less efficient
